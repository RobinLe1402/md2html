# Files from the `rlUtils` repo

The files in this directory are copied from my [`rlUtils` repo](https://rle.sh/git-repo/rlUtils).


## Why copy files from another repository here?

The issue is that the `rlUtils` repository currently uses the Microsoft Visual C++ project structure
(`.vcxproj`, `.sln`), and this one uses CMake.

Until I find a better solution (which will most likely be me turning the `rlUtils` repo into a CMake
project), I'll just keep a copy of those files in here.
